<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="container">
	<p>Jewellery or jewelry consists of decorative items worn for personal adornment, 
	such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and cufflinks. 
	Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From a western perspective, 
	the term is restricted to durable ornaments, excluding flowers for example.</p>

	<p>The word jewellery itself is derived from the word jewel, which was anglicised 
	from the Old French "jouel", and beyond that, to the Latin word "jocale", meaning 
	plaything. In British English, Indian English, New Zealand English, Hiberno-English, 
	Australian English, and South African English it is spelled jewellery, while the 
	spelling is jewelry in American English. Both are used in Canadian English, though 
	jewelry prevails by a two to one margin. In French and a few other European languages 
	the equivalent term, joaillerie, may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal 
	such as objets d'art and church items, not just objects worn on the person.</p>
