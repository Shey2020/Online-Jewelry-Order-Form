	in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I'd love to get together
	and tell you about it if you're up for a cup of coffee," 
	he continued, laying the trap he'd been planning for years.</p>

	<p>Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get 
	their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no 
	idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This 
	forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing 
	challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story 
	and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere 
	in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph 
	be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges 
	is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the 
	paragraph into their writing.</p>
